# NOTES for HW 5
I have coded the Articles and About Us pages in addition to the required Home, Shop, 
and Product Details pages. You can view them by clicking on "Articles" and "About Us"
on the header and footer nav menus.

I have also coded more than one product detail page. The two pages you can view are for
the Dog Harness (https://martinatan.github.io/homework_5/dog-harness.html) and the
Cat GPS Tracker Collar (https://martinatan.github.io/homework_5/cat-gps-tracker-collar.html).
