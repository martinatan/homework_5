# NOTES for HW 5
I have coded the Articles and About Us pages in addition to the required Home, Shop, 
and Product Details pages. You can view them by clicking on "Articles" and "About Us"
on the header and footer nav menus.

I have also coded more than one product detail page. The two pages you can view are for
the Dog Harness (https://martinatan.github.io/pui-hw5-and-hw6/homework_5/dog-harness.html) and the
Cat GPS Tracker Collar (https://martinatan.github.io/pui-hw5-and-hw6/homework_5/cat-gps-tracker-collar.html).

# NOTES for HW 6A
The Shopping Bag page, to view all items in the Bag, can be reached by clicking on the Bag icon
in the top right of aany page on the website. Or you can reach the page directly at the following URL:
https://martinatan.github.io/pui-hw5-and-hw6/homework_6a/bag.html

You can test the editable Product Detail page with feedback by going to the Product Detail page
for the Cat GPS Tracker Collar OR the Dog Harness. The color, size, and quantity can all be changed with
feedback on the page, and these product settings can then be added to the Bag by clicking the "Add to Bag"
button. See how the quantity in the shopping bag icon increases as you Add to Bag!

# NOTES for HW 6B
to-do:
    * Turn HTML event listeners into add Event Listener functions, test
    * Dynamically add row of the Bag based on what's in the Bag, test (add more info like shipping and img src to JSON)
    * Update Bag price based on items in Bag
    * Update image on product detail page
    * no edit Bag functionality because I'm mean/evil :)

Thanks for viewing! I hope you enjoy exploring the prototype.
